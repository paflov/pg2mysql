# pg2mysql
a actualized version of lightbox' pg2mysql.php

I foond this script to convert postgres dumps to MySql dumps here: http://www.lightbox.ca/pg2mysql.php
wich is from 2011. It did not work with current version of PHP (5.6 or so) and MySQL, so I made a corrected Version wich you can find here. I can not promise, that it will work with your version.
